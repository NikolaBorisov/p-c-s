= Introduction =

This page will help you to set up and run a Grader. The process right now is too complicated and need to be simplified. Please add your suggestions on how to do this here.


= Requirements =

  * Unix system
  * Copy of the source code of the Grader. It would be better if you can just download it from the svn. 'svn co http://p-c-s.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dev/grader/' is all you need.
  * SSH has to be enabled (it is used to copy files from the Storage)

= Setup =

  # Compile the C extension.
    'cd grader/pcs/ext/'
    'ruby extconf.rb'
    'make'

  # Edit the configuration file 'config.rb'. You should change the content of the following lines to match you configuration. In production mode the grader will need a user with low privileges that will be used to execute the solutions. For testing purpose you can put your own user:

'grader.execute_uid = 1000
grader.user = "borisof"
grader.grader_address = "127.0.0.1"
grader.grader_ssh_port = "22"'
  
  # Follow this mini HOWTO to set up 'scp' to work without password.

  # Start the Grader by 'ruby start_grader.rb'
