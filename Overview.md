Competitions in Computer Science have rapidly developed in recent years. This is creating a need of a software product that can aid the work connected with hosting a contest, and also help young people to develop their algorithmic skills through well prepared and suitable for their level training. Because Bulgaria will be host of the 21st International Olympiad in Informatics our goal is to develop software that will host this big event. The importance and the prestige of the event require the system to be extremely reliable and easily customizable. At the Computer Science competitions students are usually given several tasks that they have to solve in certain time. To solve a problem student must write a computer program in one of the allowed languages and submit it through the system. The score that the student receives for given task depends on how many of the problem tests the user program solves. The rules of different computer science contests differ from one another. Our goal is PCS to be able to host contest with different rules. PCS has to support a database of tasks and articles that will be managed by users through web interface. Through web interface users will be able to solve problems, read articles, and organize contest and training courses. PCS will automate this process and reduce the chances of human error.
